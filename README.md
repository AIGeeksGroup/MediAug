## Introduction
Data augmentation is essential in medical imaging for improving classification accuracy, lesion detection, and organ segmentation under limited data conditions. However, two significant challenges remain. First, a pronounced domain gap between natural photographs and medical images can distort critical disease features. Second, augmentation studies in medical imaging are fragmented and limited to single tasks or architectures, leaving the benefits of advanced mix-based strategies unclear. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework with six mix-based augmentation methods integrated with both convolutional and transformer backbones on brain tumour MRI and eye disease fundus datasets. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We introduce MediAug, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark for advanced data augmentation in medical imaging. (2) We systematically evaluate MixUp, YOCO, CropMix, CutMix, AugMix, and SnapMix with ResNet-50 and ViT-B backbones. (3) We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MixUp yields the greatest improvement on the brain tumor classification task for ResNet-50 with 79.19% accuracy and SnapMix yields the greatest improvement for ViT-B with 99.44% accuracy, and that YOCO yields the greatest improvement on the eye disease classification task for ResNet-50 with 91.60% accuracy and CutMix yields the greatest improvement for ViT-B with 97.94% accuracy.

### 🧿 Eye Diseases Classification (RGB)

* **URL**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification)
* Classes: Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Normal
* Balanced dataset
* Random split: 80% train / 20% test

<p align="left">

  <img src="https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MediAug/blob/main/eye_tsne.jpg" width="33%" />
</p>

The left pie chart shows the class distribution across the four categories, demonstrating good class balance. The right t-SNE plot provides a feature-level visualization of the high-dimensional distribution of eye disease samples after dimensionality reduction.

### 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classification (Grayscale)

* **URL**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data)
* Classes: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor
* Imbalanced dataset
* Random split: 80% train / 20% test

## 🏗️ Method Overview

We evaluate six mix-based visual augmentation techniques:

* `MixUp`: Interpolation between image-label pairs
* `YOCO`: Patch-based diverse local/global transforms
* `CropMix`: Multi-scale random crop blending
* `CutMix`: Box-replace image regions + interpolated labels
* `AugMix`: Diverse chained augmentations with consistency
* `SnapMix`: CAM-based semantic-aware mixing

Each method is evaluated on two backbones:

* **ResNet-50** (CNN)
* **ViT-B** (Transformer)
